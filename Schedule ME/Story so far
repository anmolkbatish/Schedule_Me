I've used TinyDB to story data across multiple pages.

So far, a user needs to put in their name the first time they use the application.

They can create schedules and view them.

I am still working on assigning schedules to different days.

Thanks for your help

PS - when commiting a new version, please describe the feature that you have added.
I will be able to look at them and test it out.

Cheers
