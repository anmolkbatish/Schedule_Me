Hi
As I said, this is an android application

It uses Mit App Inventor 2 platform
http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/

To get a gist of the application and see what I've done so far, you may install it on your android device.

For Non-Android users out there, you may install android emulator using App Inventor 2 website (read documentation)
or just download one from google. 

log in and create a new project
Import the __.aia file and you can start editing.

Cheers
